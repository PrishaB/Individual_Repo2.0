# Test Corrections
## Final Test 1
### Score: 43/50
#### Question 2: According to the domain name system (DNS), which of the following is a subdomain of the domain example.com?
#### Right answer: about.example.com
#### Corrections: I think I misread the answer choices. This is the right answer because the question never specified which region the domain came from so you can't add UK and about makes sense for a subdomain.

#### Question 24: Which of the following best explains how data is typically assembled in packets for transmission over the Internet?
#### Right Answer: Each packet contains data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing information used for routing the data.
#### Corrections: Data is being transmitted, not just bundled up

#### Question 37: The following code segment is intended to set max equal to the maximum value among the integer variables x, y, and z. The code segment does not work as intended in all cases. Which of the following initial values for x, y, and z can be used to show that the code segment does not work as intended?
#### Right Answer: x = 3, y = 2, z = 1
#### Corrections: OHHH OK SO, the function only works if y or z are the maximum values because the second if else statement isn't under the original if statement so it changes the max value to either y or z when executed.

#### Question 41: The figure below represents a network of physically linked computers labeled A through G. A line between two computers indicates that the computers can communicate directly with each other. Any information sent between two computers that are not directly connected must go through at least one other computer. For example, information can be sent directly between computers A and B, but information sent between computers A and C must go through other computers. What is the minimum number of connections that must be broken or removed in the network before computer E can no longer communicate with computer F?
#### Right Answer: 3
#### Corrections: Only need to take down lines connected to F. Once those lines are down, no one, not even E can connect.

#### Question 49: An Internet service provider (ISP) is considering an update to its servers that would save copies of the Web pages most frequently visited by each user. Which of the following is LEAST likely to occur as a result of the update?
#### Right Answer: Web sites that are not visited frequently might no longer be accessible to users.
#### Corrections: The actions of the ISP will only affect how frequently visited pages are loaded into Web browsers. Pages not saved by the ISP are still accessed as they were before.

#### Question 50: Digital images are often represented by the red, green, and blue values (an RGB triplet) of each individual pixel in the image. A photographer is manipulating a digital image and overwriting the original image. Which of the following describes a lossless transformation of the digital image?
#### Right Answer: Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255. The negative of an image is reversed from the original; light areas appear dark, and colors are reversed.
#### Corrections: If a negative of the original image is made, each RGB triplet value will be computed by subtracting the original value from 255. The original value can then be restored by subtracting the new value from 255. This process is lossless because the exact original can be restored.

## Final Test 2
### Score: 44/50
#### Question 1: Which of the following best describes the ability of parallel computing solutions to improve efficiency?
#### Right Answer: The efficiency of a solution that can be broken down into parallel portions is still limited by a sequential portion.
#### Corrections: Correct. Parallel computing solutions consist of a parallel portion and a sequential portion. When increasing the use of parallel computing in a solution, the efficiency of the solution is limited by the sequential portion. This means that at some point, adding parallel portions will no longer meaningfully increase efficiency.

#### Question 5: Which of the following activities is most likely to be successful as a citizen science project?
#### Right Answer: Collecting pictures of plants from around the world that can be analyzed to look for regional differences in plant growth.
#### Corrections: citizen science project requires data collection help from a wide range of people and this one is most accurate to that definition.

#### Question 12: Which of the following applications is most likely to benefit from the use of crowdsourcing?
#### Right Answer: An application that allows users to view descriptions and photographs of local landmarks
#### Corrections: Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the Internet. Study key terms.

#### Question 41: The owner of a clothing store records the following information for each transaction made at the store during a 7-day period.

- The date of the transaction
- The method of payment used in the transaction
- The number of items purchased in the transaction
- The total amount of the transaction, in dollars
- Customers can pay for purchases using cash, check, a debit card, or a credit card.

#### Using only the data collected during the 7-day period, which of the following statements is true?
#### Right Answer: The total number of items purchased on a given date can be determined by searching the data for all transactions that occurred on the given date and then adding the number of items purchased for each matching transaction.
#### Corrections: For each transaction, the data includes the date of the transaction and the number of items purchased in the transaction. By searching the data to find all transactions that occurred on the given date, and then adding the number of items purchased in each of those transactions, the total number of items purchased on a given date can be determined.

#### Question 42: Which of the following statements describe how cloud computing has affected Internet communication? Select two answers.
#### Right Answer: Cloud computing has introduced new data-security concerns. (I only got one wrong so yeah)
#### Corrections: Cloud computing sites must consider security concerns in order to protect their usersâ€™ private data.

#### Question 50: Question is long so, basically given a segment of a student record storing database and asked what can I determine from the information.
#### Right Answer: I, II, and III
#### Corrections: All three options were correct. You could determine everything from the database.
