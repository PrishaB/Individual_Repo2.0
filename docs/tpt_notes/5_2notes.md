### 5.2 Notes -> Digital Divide
* Computer privileges can result in widening gap between people
    * poorer places don't have much technological access
    * different countries = different restrictions -> US has loads of freedom while China doesn't
    * not everyone can afford newest tech so forced to work with older devices
    * religious groups (Amish por ejemplo) can't use tech
* Pandemic start -> 90,000 kids in New Jersey didn't have access to computers for distance learning
    * makes it hard for them to keep up in school while other kids thrive
    * schools forced to provide for those students -> requires resources
* Problems with technology/electronics in a school environment:
    * Most prefer own laptops because internet blockers at routers make school computers less effective for those who don't have the admin password
    * Schools focus more on scaring kids about the dangers of the internet instead of helping them understand how to use tech the right way -> this widens the divide since more kids are reluctant to try using electronics

#### Questions for 5.2
1. How does someone empower themselves in a digital world?
    * They can gain easy access to tools that allow them to better themselves which makes them feel better about themselves in real life. They also have access to tools online that makes them feel great in the virtual world since their ability to share their knowledge and skills is also made easier.
2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
    * Teaching other people important life skills is something that could help them feel better about themselves. For instance, I could provide assistance to someone who isn't as good at using computers and help them learn more which then allows me to gain confidence in my own abilities
3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
    * I'm not sure to be honest but maybe?
