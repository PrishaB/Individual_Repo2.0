### 5.6 Notes -> Safe Computing
* Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
    *  Creating Web Sites and posting information is adding a searchable PII
    *  Problem: people post on LinkedIn and forget that other people may look at their IG and FB
* Things you should consider when adding PII
    *  Good: Name, email (preferably junk email), picture, high school attended, college attended, properties you own, State-City of residence, all State-City of previous residence, Credit Report
    *  Gray: Birthdate, place of birth, street address, phone number, maiden names of Mother and Grandmother, Drivers License Number
    *  Bad: Credentials for Access, Two-Factor Authentication on Financial accounts, SSN, Tax records
* Beware, Establish practices for your own Safety
    *  Multi-factor authentication --> enter code that has been texted or emailed to you. Also biometrics
    *  Malware often sent in attachments to things in email --> click attachment and it adds virus to computer
    *  Phishing --> promise one thing through a link only to steal your info
* Factors to Increase Security
    *  Use Multi Factor Authentication
    *  Biometrics --> secure systems, fingerprints, or facial recognition
    *  Symmetric encryption --> only one key used to encrypt and decrypt electronic info
    *  Asymmetric cryptography --> (aka public-key cryptography) use pair of key to encrypt/decrypt a message and protect it from unauthorized access/use
    *  SSL uses asymmetric and symmetric encryption
* Nefarious Uses of Internet
    *  Virus/Malware
    *  Phishing
* GitHub Pages:
    *  Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
        * Contact info pages, Database/CRUD
    *  What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
        * I believe it's probably a good idea to share as little personal information as possible because you don't need random people to know everything about you.
    *  Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
        * Bad passwords contain personal information, isn't complex (doesn't contain special characters and numbers), and is too short. A step that you can use to assist in authentication is Multi Factor Authentication which provides and added layer of security to your entry.
    *  Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
        * In symmetric encryption, you only have one key. In asymmetric, you use a pair of keys to encrypt/decrypt messages.
    *  Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
        * An example of encryption we used in deployment was creating an AWS account.
    *  Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
        * I've never suffered from a phishing scheme. I do remember once when that Discord virus was running wild and a friend of mine 'gifted me free nitro'. I was suspicious of the link and waited for any further confirmation (and if she didn't provide it I was going to search up the url to see if it was reliable). Other phishing techniques could come from emails or other sites.
