### 5.3 Notes -> Computer Bias
* Computer bias: result of human error and bias -> human bias inadvertantly seeps into computing
* Intentional/Purposeful Bias:
1. Facebook vs TikTok, is there purposeful exclusion? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
    * I don't use either application so I'm not entirely sure whether or not there is bias. From what I've noticed, however, is that mostly elderly people use Facebook while younger people use TikTok. I guess in targetting one or the other age group, you lose potential customers so it could be bad for business. However, targetting one or the other group ensures that people who understand each other will be in contact with each other.
2. Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri original had flaws in detecting accents or young voices, was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
    * I believe it may have been unintentional since the products belong to big companies who rely on all kinds of customers to sell their goods. It should be corrected because if it isn't fix, people are unlikely to use those products which results in a loss of profit which makes it bad for business.
3. Netflix, do their algorithm purposely bias certain content to certain watchers? Is it harmful? Is it good business?
    * They probably do it intentionally so that people are able to find content they enjoy easily. This isn't harmful and is good for business since it makes it so more people want to watch Netflix since they find shows/movies they enjoy quickly and efficiently.

* HP Video Notes:
    * It seems like the owner thinks bias is intentional since he calls HP laptops racist.
    * I think the company only tested with paler skinned people because that's who was present for the testing phase so it may have been unintentional bias.
    * It is harmful because it could hurt people who have darker skin and require this face tracking mechanism.
    * I believe this should be corrected because it could negatively impact HP.
    * In the testing phase, I would use people from various backgrounds to make sure the program works for various people.
