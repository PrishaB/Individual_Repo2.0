### 5.5 Notes -> Legal and Ethical Concerns
* Section is about Free Software Licensing
* Lawyers make profession on Patents --> can be impacted by General Public Licensing (GPL)
* Qualcomm makes money on patents
* Using GPL makes it so you can't charge for others using your software and patents
* Open Source --> derivative work free and code shared
* Royalty Payment --> anyone who uses idea/patent needs to pay
* Black Duck software composition analysis (SCA) -> manage security, quality, and licence compliance risks from using open source and third-party code
* Qualcomm has a huge team to run security risks and such so they can make money off patents
* Basically, make sure you are careful about the code you copy and ensure you know the restrictions based on the software license you are copying off
* When selecting a license, need to ask:
    *  Do I want to waive default copyright in reuse?
    *  Do I want to allow derivative works or not?
    *  Do I want to require all deivative code to be shared?
* Creative Commons CCO Public Domain Dedication waives copyright interest in a work you've created and dedicates it to a www public domain
* Open Source MIT License --> friendly to people like Qualcomm --> allows code to be used freely in making and distributed closed source versions
* Open Source GPL license --> can do anything except distribute
* Make sure you comply with terms of licenses --> cite sources
* Can be complicated to understand all Creative Commons Licenses:
    * Music companies build DRM (Ditgital Rights Management) software to protect, play and/or distribute content
    * Open Source usually used for educational purposes so it is good for class
    * When using Open Source companies need to find techniques and business models for Open Source software to work as per the license
    * Many people use Red Hat business model because of it's amazing Initial Public Offering (IPO)
      Questions:
1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.
* Github has a site which allows you to chose from three diffent overarching groups --> work in community, simple, and sharing improvements
* Based on that you can decide which main branch you want to go down and then finalize
2. Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.
* Maybe thinking of using something that works for a community since it's a page in which other people need to access in order to buy the masks.
