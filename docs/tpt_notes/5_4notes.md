### 5.4 Notes -> Crowdsourcing
* Crowdsourcing helps to reduce computar bias by allowing users to participate in data collection
* Ex:
    * Wikipedia uses crowdsourcing by allowing users to provide their own inputs on certain topics. This results in a few inaccuracies but having a wide variety of people provide their own input, many believe it's better than 'official' info.
    * Crypto currency is an example but I don't really get how it works so yeah
    * COVID data -> based on how the pandemic spreads, we are able to make decisions on attending social events and stuff
* Obtaining Data via Crowdsourcing
    * APIs -> RapidAPI
    * GitHub -> we can analyze other people's code and share with others
* Questions:
    * CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
        * To crowdsource in CSP, we could write a coding program that takes in user feedback and stores it in a database for the coder to find. They can use that data to better their website.
    *  What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
        * We could take student input on what they feel is needed in school and use that data to write a program that benefits the students.
