## Week 1
### 5.3 Notes -> Computer Bias
* Computer bias: result of human error and bias -> human bias inadvertantly seeps into computing
* Intentional/Purposeful Bias:
1. Facebook vs TikTok, is there purposeful exclusion? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
   * I don't use either application so I'm not entirely sure whether or not there is bias. From what I've noticed, however, is that mostly elderly people use Facebook while younger people use TikTok. I guess in targetting one or the other age group, you lose potential customers so it could be bad for business. However, targetting one or the other group ensures that people who understand each other will be in contact with each other.
2. Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri original had flaws in detecting accents or young voices, was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
   * I believe it may have been unintentional since the products belong to big companies who rely on all kinds of customers to sell their goods. It should be corrected because if it isn't fix, people are unlikely to use those products which results in a loss of profit which makes it bad for business.
3. Netflix, do their algorithm purposely bias certain content to certain watchers? Is it harmful? Is it good business?
   * They probably do it intentionally so that people are able to find content they enjoy easily. This isn't harmful and is good for business since it makes it so more people want to watch Netflix since they find shows/movies they enjoy quickly and efficiently.

* HP Video Notes:
   * It seems like the owner thinks bias is intentional since he calls HP laptops racist.
   * I think the company only tested with paler skinned people because that's who was present for the testing phase so it may have been unintentional bias.
   * It is harmful because it could hurt people who have darker skin and require this face tracking mechanism.
   * I believe this should be corrected because it could negatively impact HP.
   * In the testing phase, I would use people from various backgrounds to make sure the program works for various people.

### 5.4 Notes -> Crowdsourcing
* Crowdsourcing helps to reduce computar bias by allowing users to participate in data collection
* Ex:
  * Wikipedia uses crowdsourcing by allowing users to provide their own inputs on certain topics. This results in a few inaccuracies but having a wide variety of people provide their own input, many believe it's better than 'official' info.
  * Crypto currency is an example but I don't really get how it works so yeah
  * COVID data -> based on how the pandemic spreads, we are able to make decisions on attending social events and stuff
* Obtaining Data via Crowdsourcing
  * APIs -> RapidAPI
  * GitHub -> we can analyze other people's code and share with others
* Questions:
  * CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
    * To crowdsource in CSP, we could write a coding program that takes in user feedback and stores it in a database for the coder to find. They can use that data to better their website.
  *  What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
     * We could take student input on what they feel is needed in school and use that data to write a program that benefits the students.

## Week 0
### 5.1 Notes -> Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing
* UAVs/Drones are useful for search and rescue, hobbies, and various things but have negative effects 
   * UAVs/Drones can result in an invasion of privacy as well as other dangers
* Technology can also produce dopamine which allows us to feel pleasure -> can be dangerous since people will get addicted
   * Anthony Rosner was obsessed with World of Warcraft and is a king in that world but in the real world he's a no one, his grades suffer as well as his body and relationships
   * He later realizes just how valuable it is to immerse yourself in reality and creates a vlog called IRL - In Real Life to teach other people how he got away from his gaming addiction
   * His films are also very big and renowned world wide -> break from gaming helped him learn how to do this
* Automated telephone trees created to help save employers money and reduce customer hold time
   * Can be problematic since customer talking to real person is not guaranteed

#### Questions for 5.1
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
   * Makes tasks easier -> makes people lazier
   * Provides entertainment -> people get addicted and neglect real life
   * Gives people power to do more things -> results in them abusing their powers
2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
   * If dopamine is the only issue, there are various other things in real life that produce the same/similar effects so not only technology will cause addiction and bad habits. As long as people can control their addictions, it isn't too much of a problem. I need to learn how to control my addictions as well because it makes it harder to focus in class because of it.


### 5.2 Notes -> Digital Divide
* Computer privileges can result in widening gap between people
   * poorer places don't have much technological access
   * different countries = different restrictions -> US has loads of freedom while China doesn't
   * not everyone can afford newest tech so forced to work with older devices
   * religious groups (Amish por ejemplo) can't use tech
* Pandemic start -> 90,000 kids in New Jersey didn't have access to computers for distance learning
   * makes it hard for them to keep up in school while other kids thrive
   * schools forced to provide for those students -> requires resources
* Problems with technology/electronics in a school environment:
   * Most prefer own laptops because internet blockers at routers make school computers less effective for those who don't have the admin password
   * Schools focus more on scaring kids about the dangers of the internet instead of helping them understand how to use tech the right way -> this widens the divide since more kids are reluctant to try using electronics

#### Questions for 5.2
1. How does someone empower themselves in a digital world?
   * They can gain easy access to tools that allow them to better themselves which makes them feel better about themselves in real life. They also have access to tools online that makes them feel great in the virtual world since their ability to share their knowledge and skills is also made easier.
2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
   * Teaching other people important life skills is something that could help them feel better about themselves. For instance, I could provide assistance to someone who isn't as good at using computers and help them learn more which then allows me to gain confidence in my own abilities
3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
   * I'm not sure to be honest but maybe?
