## Week 0
### 5.1 Notes -> Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing
* UAVs/Drones are useful for search and rescue, hobbies, and various things but have negative effects 
   * UAVs/Drones can result in an invasion of privacy as well as other dangers
* Technology can also produce dopamine which allows us to feel pleasure -> can be dangerous since people will get addicted
   * Anthony Rosner was obsessed with World of Warcraft and is a king in that world but in the real world he's a no one, his grades suffer as well as his body and relationships
   * He later realizes just how valuable it is to immerse yourself in reality and creates a vlog called IRL - In Real Life to teach other people how he got away from his gaming addiction
   * His films are also very big and renowned world wide -> break from gaming helped him learn how to do this
* Automated telephone trees created to help save employers money and reduce customer hold time
   * Can be problematic since customer talking to real person is not guaranteed

#### Questions for 5.1
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
   * Makes tasks easier -> makes people lazier
   * Provides entertainment -> people get addicted and neglect real life
   * Gives people power to do more things -> results in them abusing their powers
2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
   * If dopamine is the only issue, there are various other things in real life that produce the same/similar effects so not only technology will cause addiction and bad habits. As long as people can control their addictions, it isn't too much of a problem. I need to learn how to control my addictions as well because it makes it harder to focus in class because of it.


### 5.2 Notes -> Digital Divide
* Computer privileges can result in widening gap between people
   * poorer places don't have much technological access
   * different countries = different restrictions -> US has loads of freedom while China doesn't
   * not everyone can afford newest tech so forced to work with older devices
   * religious groups (Amish por ejemplo) can't use tech
* Pandemic start -> 90,000 kids in New Jersey didn't have access to computers for distance learning
   * makes it hard for them to keep up in school while other kids thrive
   * schools forced to provide for those students -> requires resources
* Problems with technology/electronics in a school environment:
   * Most prefer own laptops because internet blockers at routers make school computers less effective for those who don't have the admin password
   * Schools focus more on scaring kids about the dangers of the internet instead of helping them understand how to use tech the right way -> this widens the divide since more kids are reluctant to try using electronics

#### Questions for 5.2
1. How does someone empower themselves in a digital world?
   * They can gain easy access to tools that allow them to better themselves which makes them feel better about themselves in real life. They also have access to tools online that makes them feel great in the virtual world since their ability to share their knowledge and skills is also made easier.
2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
   * Teaching other people important life skills is something that could help them feel better about themselves. For instance, I could provide assistance to someone who isn't as good at using computers and help them learn more which then allows me to gain confidence in my own abilities
3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
   * I'm not sure to be honest but maybe?
